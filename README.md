# FourFunctionCalculator
This is a simple found function calculator (as the title implies) that was assigned during my Android Development class. This was the first assignment, and my first endeavor with Android.

## Known bugs
- None off the top of my head.

## Aside
Some of the functionality is mostly mimicked from the Windows version of the calculator. The main difference is that I the operator is replaced each time it's selected before and/or after hitting the equal button (=).
